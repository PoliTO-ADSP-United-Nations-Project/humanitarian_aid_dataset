# Time-Series Forecasting for Humanitarian Aid (dataset)

We present in this repository the most important result of the project carried out in collaboration with the UNSSC: a new dataset for time-series forecasting on migratory flows.

To the best of our knowledge, no similar dataset currently exists that aggregates the information we report, or that could be used for a similar purpose.

## Dataset Descritpion
The dataset created starts from a preliminary assumption: in general, the first countries of arrival in Europe are Italy, Spain, and Greece. This assumption derives not only from the evident geographical conformations of the Mediterranean and the migratory routes, but also from the scarcity of data regarding the rest of the European nations.

Given this assumption, we show in this graph the countries of origin of the potential migratory flows, which have a more consistent impact on the data.
